## üéì From Foundations to Frontiers: My Engineering Chapter

<p align="justify">
At PES University, my journey through the Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering program, spanning August 2018 to May 2022, was a blend of rigorous academics and explorative projects. With a notable GPA of 8.5, the curriculum ventured beyond traditional engineering disciplines, embracing areas like Data Structures and Algorithms, Full Stack Development, and Machine Learning. Little did I know, this was just the beginning of my tech adventure!
